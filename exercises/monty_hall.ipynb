    "The Monty Hall problem is an infamous puzzle that challenges human intuition about\n",

    "\n",
    ">Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors:\n",
    "Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1,\n",
    "and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3,\n",
    "which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it\n",
    "to your advantage to switch your choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "Put more clearly, we have the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. You initially pick a door with no information, except that two\n",
    "doors have goats behind them and one has a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. The host must always open a door that was not picked by you.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. The host must always open a door to reveal a goat and never the\n",
    "car.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. The host must always offer the chance to switch between the\n",

    "Famed mathematician Paul Erdős refused to accept any explanation or formal\n",
    "proof for this problem, and insisted on a seeing the results of a simulation.\n",
    "Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to satisfy Erdős’s requirement.\n",
    "Take some time to think about your answer to the problem, then implement a\n",
